 *

 * club or we write to it, because gasf_crm_touch_contact re-inserts it. That is
 * the correct behaviour for a derived table, but "delete" reads as "block" to
 * most people, so the admin screen says so on the confirmation and again in the
 * notice afterwards. Deleting is for tidying a typo or a one-off out of the
 * forward autocomplete; it is not a way to stop hearing from somebody.
 *
 * Logged, because "where did that address go?" is otherwise unanswerable.
