 * poster or a Facebook post.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the Media Library. That holds 1,400-odd files, almost all of
 * them website furniture — button backgrounds, sponsor logos, theme headers —
 * and a volunteer looking for "a good picture of the Biergarten" should not have
 * to wade through them. The library is only photos the club has actually
 * catalogued: submissions that were approved, plus anything a volunteer has
 * tagged by hand.
 *
 * Reads only. Nothing here changes a photo, so there is no revision, no lock and
 * no state machine — the worst a bug in this file can do is show somebody the
 * wrong list, which is a different order of problem from the rest of this build.

 *   - or catalogued by the EXIF backfill (_gasf_photo_autotag).
 *
 * That third route exists because the first version required a TERM, and a
 * photo the backfill could date but not place — no GPS, and several club events
 * that day — got none. Sixty-one real club photos were dated and then invisible:
 * a Valentine's dinner, a February camera roll, portraits. A known date is
 * cataloguing; the library is where catalogued photos live.
 *
 * Merged in PHP rather than expressed as one query because WP_Query cannot OR a
 * meta_query against a tax_query. At this size that is not worth a custom join:
 * both halves are indexed lookups and the union is a few hundred integers.
 *
 * Private photos are excluded outright. Anything still awaiting review is not
 * cleared for use, and this list exists to be used from.
