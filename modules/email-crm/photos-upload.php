/**
 * Bulk upload — modules/email-crm/photos-upload.php
 *
 * The other way photos get into the collection.
 *
 * Everything else in this module arrives by email from a member, which is why
 * it has an intake queue, an invitation, a reminder and a review step: we do
 * not know who sent it, whether they took it, or whether we may use it. A
 * volunteer emptying their own camera after an event has already answered all
 * three, and making them post 25 photos to themselves to get them in would be
 * a ceremony that protects nobody.
 *
 * So this is a shorter path, not a looser one. It skips the queue, the invite
 * and the reminders. It does NOT skip the two things that exist for the
 * subject's sake rather than the club's:
 *
 *   - Permission is recorded, with a note, exactly as a volunteer recording it
 *     by hand for an emailed photo. The tickbox is not a formality; without it
 *     the request is refused.
 *   - Every file is scrubbed of EXIF before it becomes readable, by the same
 *     publish path emailed photos go through. Uploads land in the private
 *     review folder first and are published from there, so there is never a
 *     moment where an unscrubbed file sits in the webroot.
 *
 * One file per request, deliberately. PHP's max_file_uploads defaults to 20,
 * so a single POST carrying 25 photos silently drops five of them — no error,
 * no warning, just fewer pictures than you dragged in. Uploading them one at a
 * time also means a failure is one photo's problem rather than the batch's,
 * and the person watching gets a progress line per file instead of a spinner.
