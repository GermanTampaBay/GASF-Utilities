 *   2. A volunteer opens the thread at /email and APPROVES the images worth
 *      keeping. Each one is sideloaded into the Media Library, carrying its
 *      provenance and whatever EXIF the file still had (see 43-photo-catalog).
 *   3. The CRM emails the sender a private link asking what the photos are.
 *   4. They fill in date, place, event, who is in each one, and a caption.
 *   5. Their answers are stored PENDING. They are not terms yet.
 *   6. A volunteer confirms them, and only then do they become real tags.
 *
 * Step 5 is the important one. The tagging form is used by a member of the
 * public holding a link — nobody signs in — so anything typed there is
 * untrusted text. If it created taxonomy terms directly, the club's vocabulary
 * would be writable by anyone who was ever forwarded that email, and a
 * misspelling would be indistinguishable from a real person forever.
