/**
 * Email CRM — failure detection (modules/email-crm/health.php)
 *
 * The failure mode this exists for is silence. If Graph stops answering —
 * consent revoked, secret expired, mailbox renamed, tenant policy changed —
 * mail simply stops arriving and the inbox looks exactly like a quiet week.
 * Nobody investigates a quiet week. The club would go on not answering its
 * public email address until somebody happened to notice, which could be a
 * month.
 *
 * One failed sync means nothing: Graph has transient errors, and the hourly
 * cron will pick the mail up next time round. A full day of them means
 * something is actually broken and a person needs to look.
 *
 * The alert email is best effort and deliberately not the primary channel. If
 * Graph is what broke, we cannot send through it, and wp_mail on this host is
 * quarantined by the domain's own SPF record. The banner on /email and the
 * admin notice do not depend on mail working at all, which is the whole point.
