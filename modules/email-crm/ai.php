 * Email CRM — Claude Haiku reply drafts (modules/email-crm/ai.php)
 *
 * Drafts are generated ON DEMAND from a button, never automatically when a
 * thread is opened. Two reasons: spam and newsletters would otherwise burn a
 * call every time someone glances at the list, and an auto-filled compose box
 * invites sending without reading.
 *
 * The corpus is read straight out of the WordPress database rather than
 * crawled over HTTP. This module runs ON the site, so the DB is right there —
 * no scraper to maintain, nothing to break when the theme changes, and the
 * content is current by definition.
 *
 * Uses the site-wide key from gasf_anthropic_key() (Settings tab), shared with
 * the AI SEO module.
