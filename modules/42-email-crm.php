/**
 * Email CRM — modules/42-email-crm.php
 *
 * A shared-inbox CRM for info@germantampabay.com. Approved volunteers sign in
 * at /email with Google or Microsoft, see inbound mail, and reply from a web
 * form with a Claude Haiku draft as a starting point.
 *
 * Design contract: docs/EMAIL-CRM-SPEC.md
 *
 * Mail access is Microsoft Graph APP-ONLY against a SHARED mailbox — there is
 * no per-user delegation, because the volunteers' Google/Microsoft identities
 * have no relationship to the M365 tenant. The Graph app is restricted to that
 * one mailbox by an Exchange Application Access Policy scoped to the
 * gasf-crm-scope@germantampabay.com mail-enabled security group. That policy is
 * the security boundary; without it the app registration can read every mailbox
 * in the tenant. Verify with Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy after any app change.
 *
 * This file is only the loader — gate, includes, rewrite rules, cron wiring and
 * schema upgrades. Everything else lives in modules/email-crm/*.php, which the
 * plugin's own modules/*.php glob deliberately does NOT pick up (it is not
 * recursive), so load order stays under our control here.
 *
 * Gate: gasf_site_enable_emailcrm (default ON).
