/**
 * Photo catalogue — modules/43-photo-catalog.php
 *
 * Collects information ABOUT a photo, not just the photo: who is in it, where
 * and when it was taken, and what it shows.
 *
 * WHERE THE DATA LIVES, and why it is not a custom table:
 *
 *   people / place / event   taxonomies on the attachment post type
 *   date taken, GPS, camera  post meta on the attachment
 *   description              the attachment's own Caption (post_excerpt)
 *
 * An attachment is already a post, so all of this is native: it survives
 * export, it is searchable, deleting the photo takes its data with it, and a
 * misspelled name is fixed once rather than in forty rows. A parallel table
 * keyed on attachment ID would orphan itself the first time somebody deleted a
 * photo in the Media Library, and would throw away the term UI for nothing.
 *
 * People, places and events are TAXONOMIES rather than text fields for one
 * reason: "every photo of Hans" is a question you can only answer if Hans is
 * one thing. Stored as free text you get "Hans Müller", "Hans Muller" and
 * "hans müller" as three different people, permanently, and no amount of later
 * tidying finds them all.
 *
 * They are registered non-public and NOT exposed over REST. A list of the names
 * of people in the club's photos should not be a public JSON endpoint, and a
 * public taxonomy would also generate front-end archive pages for every person
 * named — which nobody asked for and which would be indexed.
 *
 * Gate: gasf_site_enable_photocatalog (default ON).

	 * gasf_crm_photo_library_ids — so a count of the direct assignments alone
	 * disagrees with the list you get by clicking the place: the Biergarten

	 * Bierhaus is one photo. Summing the children would have quietly inflated
